### WHOIS

Upon registration of a domain, information is supplied for registrant and whois contact details. This information is used in a publicly accessible database where any internet user can find the identity and contact details of a domain registrant. This is a standard feature of domain name systems worldwide, and is subject to regulation as per the jurisdiction of the domain extension (TLD).

For .au domain names, please see auDA's WHOIS policy at http://www.auda.org.au/whois-policy which sets out auDA's guidelines on the collection, disclosure and use of WHOIS data.
